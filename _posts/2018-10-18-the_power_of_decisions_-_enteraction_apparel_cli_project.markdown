Getting started is the challenge. After that, it’s all about solving a problem. Once you have a clear goal in mind, it’s a lot easier to get moving. My advice is to pick something and move forward. 

For my CLI project, I scraped the website: www.enteractionapparel.com. I had a few ideas I was playing around with initially though. I’m interested in travel, finance, and new businesses that include being remote. I was thinking about a site that directly related to my interests or something I could own as a business in the future. I actually own www.enteractionapparel.com, so I decided why not scrape my own website and see how it works. It was built with Shopify, so it wasn't clear to me exactly how it would look. I started testing out scraping using the same syntax as I did for the Student Scraper Lab. After realizing it wasn't too hard to scrape the title, I started playing around with other information. Initially, I was just playing around to see if I could scrape certain information. Eventually, I had enough information to apply it to my CLI Project.

The key was deciding where to start. Once I did that, I decided to move forward with that for the project. At that point I just had to decide what I wanted the outcome to be and program it following the same methods as the other examples. I decided the application would list out the products from the website homepage and then make them selectable. Everything learned in the previous lessons and labs made the programming easier at this point. After setting up the environment, it was just about going through the project one step at a time, fixing each error as it came up and a lot of testing with pry. Pry was definitely required. After everything in the project was working, I also decided that it would be good experience to learn how to create a gem. I clicked on the link provided in the lesson and not too much later, I had a working gem of my project.

The bottom line is that it always seems intimidating when first starting a project. There are a lot of decisions that need to be made to make it great. But if you think of it like the labs, it becomes easier. With the labs, you already know what you have to achieve in the end. You do one ruby file at a time and pass each test individually. After running learn, you start with test #1. The same should be done the projects. It will force you to make progress if you decide what you want to do. The first test is deciding where to start, then the power is in your hands.
