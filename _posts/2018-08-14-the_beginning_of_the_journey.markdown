I recently started the online Full Stack Web Development course with Flatiron School. I decided to do this because I want to give myself more freedom moving forward. Freedom in what I work on, how I get it done and how I live my life. I want to be able to use my past techical experience and knowledge to build expertise in this new field to change my life for the better.

This all started for me when I was trying to determine what I wanted to do moving forward in my carrer. I currently work for Procter and Gamble as a power and controls engineer. My current focus is design, construction and project managment at one of the manufacturing plants. I do a lot of upgrades and installations of new systems and equipment. I realized that I enjoy the controls and automation side of electrical engineering more than anything else. This means working more with the software and developing control systems in PLCs(Programmable Logic Controllers) and process control systems. Being an electrical engineer is fun for me, but I want to work doing something that allows more creativity and more felxibility in location. My goal is to develop a skillset that enables me to be technical, creative and allows me to travel more often.

After doing some research, I saw that web development was a great avenue that would contribute to the goals I've set for myself. I've enjoyed learning JavaScript and Ruby with the free bootcamp and full online course. It gives me an opportunity for creativity with a technical background and skillset. It's challenging and fun at the same time. This is something I can see myslef doing for a long time in the future. This is the beginning of the journey and I'm excited to keep it going!
